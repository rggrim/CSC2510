When you commit, the updates exist on the local devoie in your .git file
commit - save to your local repository
push - save to shared repository (server)
pull/fetch - check for updates

four ways to resolve conflicts when pushing to origin
 - accept your own (resolve with mine)
 - resolve with theirs
 - resolve with both                    # how does this work???
 - resolve with none (get rid of both)
